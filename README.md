# 3d_wireframe

This project, nicknamed FDF for the French phrase fil de fer, is a 3-d wireframe renderer that allows the user to move the image in three dimensional space. The tools used to accomplish this include key hook functions for events provided by the user and pixel display functions for the calculated output.
